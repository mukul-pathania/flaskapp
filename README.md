# MY FIRST PROJECT

This repository contains the code for the website that will(if implemented properly) be hosted to help<br>
in the process of sharing assignments between my classmates.

I would also be implementing a microblog kind of thing in parallel to this with a basic user authentication<br>
system, user profile pages,follower-following system, forgot-password facility(won't be world-class as it will<br>
be using free services), ability to write some posts, etc.

Have just started in the world of programming so, sorry for all theshortcomings and bad practices that may have<br>
crept into this work.

>*I probably don't even know what is bad.*

If you use my website (I probably forced you to check it out :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:) and have any suggestions, they are more than welcome.<br>
You probably know where to find me :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :laughing:.

Upon completion of this project you could expect these links to lead to the right place:
